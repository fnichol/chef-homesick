# Description

LWRP to manage [homesick][homesick] castles.

# Requirements

## Chef

Tested on 0.10.2 and 0.10.4 but newer and older version should work just fine.
File an [issue][issues] if this isn't the case.

## Platform

The following platforms have been tested with this cookbook, meaning that the
recipes run on these platforms without error:

* ubuntu
* debian
* mac_os_x
* suse
* openbsd

Please [report][issues] any additional platforms so they can be added.

## Cookbooks

There are **no** external cookbook dependencies. If you are using [RVM][rvm],
then you should consider using the [rvm cookbook][rvm_cb].

# Installation

Depending on the situation and use case there are several ways to install
this cookbook. All the methods listed below assume a tagged version release
is the target, but omit the tags to get the head of development. A valid
Chef repository structure like the [Opscode repo][chef_repo] is also assumed.

## From the Opscode Community Platform

To install this cookbook from the Opscode platform, use the *knife* command:

    knife cookbook site install homesick

## Using Librarian

The [Librarian][librarian] gem aims to be Bundler for your Chef cookbooks.
Include a reference to the cookbook in a **Cheffile** and run
`librarian-chef install`. To install with Librarian:

    gem install librarian
    cd chef-repo
    librarian-chef init
    cat >> Cheffile <<END_OF_CHEFFILE
    cookbook 'homesick',
      :git => 'git://github.com/fnichol/chef-homesick.git', :ref => 'v0.2.0'
    END_OF_CHEFFILE
    librarian-chef install

## Using knife-github-cookbooks

The [knife-github-cookbooks][kgc] gem is a plugin for *knife* that supports
installing cookbooks directly from a GitHub repository. To install with the
plugin:

    gem install knife-github-cookbooks
    cd chef-repo
    knife cookbook github install fnichol/chef-homesick/v0.2.0

## As a Git Submodule

A common practice (which is getting dated) is to add cookbooks as Git
submodules. This is accomplishes like so:

    cd chef-repo
    git submodule add git://github.com/fnichol/chef-homesick.git cookbooks/homesick
    git submodule init && git submodule update

**Note:** the head of development will be linked here, not a tagged release.

## As a Tarball

If the cookbook needs to downloaded temporarily just to be uploaded to a Chef
Server or Opscode Hosted Chef, then a tarball installation might fit the bill:

    cd chef-repo/cookbooks
    curl -Ls https://github.com/fnichol/chef-homesick/tarball/v0.2.0 | tar xfz - && \
      mv fnichol-chef-homesick-* homesick

# Usage

Simply include `recipe[homesick]` in your run_list and the `homesick_repo`
resource will be available.

To use `recipe[homesick::data_bag]`, include it in your run_list and have a
data bag called `"users"` with an item for your user like the following:

    {
      "id"  : "wigglebottom",
      "homesick_castles"  : [
        { "name"    : "dotvim",
          "source"  : "git://github.com/fnichol/dotvim.git"
        },
        { "name"    : "dotfiles",
          "source"  : "git://github.com/fnichol/dotfiles.git",
          "action"  : "update"
        }
      ]
    }

The data bag recipe will iterate through a list of usernames defined in
`node['users']` and attempt to pull in the homesick information from the data
bag item. In other words, having:

    node['users'] = ['hsolo']

will set up the `hsolo` user's castles and not use the `wigglebottom` user.

# Recipes

## default

This recipe is a no-op and does nothing.

Use this recipe when you only want access to the `homesick_castle` LWRP.

## data_bag

Fetches an list of homesick castles with data drawn from a data bag. The
default data bag is `"users"` and the list of user accounts to iterate through
is set on `node['users']`.

Use this recipe when you want data bag driven data in your workflow.

# Attributes

## `data_bag`

The data bag name containing a group of user account information. This is used
by the `data_bag` recipe to use as a database of user accounts. The default is
`"users"`.

# Resources and Providers
